# Spatium3D
My biggest project to date.

Spatium3D is a soon-to-be open-source 3D computer graphics software programmed in Python. Uses the OpenGL library.

This program is named after the Latin word for 'space' and '3D' - Essentially, 3-dimensional space.

# Why are your versions titled, 'One', 'Two', 'Three', etc.?
I wanted to stray away from semantic & similar versioning schemes because I feel like every update will be a very significant one. However, numbered sub-versions will appear next to the version word if there is a critical vulnerability that needs to be patched, or similarly another important emergency fix (e.g. 'Spatium3D One (1.1)', 'Spatium3D Two (2.1)', etc.).

There is an internal build number (e.g. 1.2.345), however, only the first two numbers of the build number are referenced in release logs (only during emergency updates, usually it would just be 'One', 'Two', 'Three', etc.). The tertiary number is to keep track of the number of changes to Spatium3D since its creation.

# Features
Spatium3D will use high-performance, efficient algorithms to ensure that it runs well no matter the processing power. That being said, I have no plans of bringing this to mobile or VR platforms. I plan to get features relating to modelling and rendering (such as rigging and shaders) done by One's full release. Scanning will come in a future version.

# Release Date
I plan to have Spatium3D One released in March 2025.
